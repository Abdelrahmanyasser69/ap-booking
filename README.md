⚠️ Important note about CAPTCHA / Cloudflare

The **demo site** sometimes shows a Cloudflare / CAPTCHA challenge before allowing automation to proceed.  
When this happens, you **must manually solve the CAPTCHA in the browser** (tick the checkbox or click the images) and wait until the demo page fully loads.  

Only after the page is visible and functional, press **ENTER** in the console if prompted.  
This is by design because automation cannot bypass CAPTCHA for you.
